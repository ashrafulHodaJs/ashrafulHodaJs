Hey, I'm Ashraful Hoda. What started as simple curiosity about web dev has turned into a deep dive into the depths of **low-level programming**, **UNIX**, and a fascination with **exploitation** (no pun intended). 🚀

I’m currently lost in the wonderful world of **C**, **Assembly**, **Lua**, and **Linux**—building projects that make the OS tick rather than just showing a shiny frontend.

### 🛠️ Where I Started: The Web Dev Years

A while back, I was all about **vanilla JavaScript** and building static websites. It was fun, but something always felt missing. After experimenting with some small frontend projects, I realized I was more interested in what happens **under the hood**. I spent hours exploring **vanilla JS**, but soon, the bright lights of the browser couldn’t hold me. 🔍

### ⚡ The Shift: From Frontend to Low-Level

My curiosity started to drift towards **low-level programming**. The more I explored, the more I realized how much I love the intricacies of how computers really work. From **C** to **Assembly**, I couldn’t resist the urge to dig deeper into memory management, registers, and system calls. It's like peeling back the layers of a machine to see how it ticks.

I started playing with **UNIX** systems and quickly found myself loving the raw power of the terminal. From **bash scripting** to understanding **process management**, **file systems**, and **kernels**, it's clear that the more I learn, the more I realize there's always something new to explore. 🔧

### 💥 Current Focus: Exploitation, OSDev, and Lua

Right now, my focus is on **exploitation** and **OS development**. I love understanding how vulnerabilities work and diving into **buffer overflows**, **reverse engineering**, and **security**. I’m building retro games in **C**, tinkering with **low-level system programming**, and even dabbling in **Lua** to see how it can be used for game dev and scripting.

I haven't completely given up on **frontend**, but let's just say I haven't gone beyond **vanilla JS**. I prefer the backend, or rather, the OS and kernel-level magic. **UNIX** is my domain, and I find joy in every shell command I run. 💻

### 🔧 My Toolkit
- **Languages I Speak**:  
  - **C** (my first love for low-level work)  
  - **Assembly** (because why not dive into raw machine code?)  
  - **Lua** (a powerful little language for scripting and games)  
  - **Python** (for when I need high-level but still powerful solutions)  
  - **Bash** (my terminal's best friend)

- **OS & Tools**:  
  - **Linux** (Ubuntu, Kali, and experimenting with my own kernels)  
  - **Git** (to track my journey)  
  - **GDB** (my debugger companion)  
  - **VSCode** (when I need an IDE, though I mostly prefer Vim or the terminal)

- **My Current Projects**:  
  - **Building a retro game engine** in **C**  
  - **Reverse engineering random software** to see how it ticks  
  - **Experimenting with writing my own operating system kernel**  
  - **Exploit development** (security is fun when you learn how things break)

### 🚧 Still Learning...

I’m always on the lookout for new challenges and ways to grow. The deeper I go into **systems programming** and **exploitation**, the more excited I get about the endless possibilities. If you’re into **reverse engineering**, **kernel hacking**, or just want to chat about **low-level systems**, let’s connect!

> **Remember**: It’s not about the flashy front-end, it’s about what’s happening behind the scenes. That’s where the magic lies. 🔮
